<h1>user experience design</h1>

<b>Start fast, fail early</b>
<p><b>User experience design (UXD</b> or <b>UED)</b> is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the <em>interaction</em> between the user and the product.
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">wikipedia definition</a>
  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<b>History</b>
<p>The field of user experience design has roots in <b>human factors</b> and <b>ergonomics</b>, a field that, since the late 1940s, has focused on the <em>interaction</em> between human users, machines, and the contextual environments to design systems that address the user's experience. With the proliferation of workplace computers in the early 1990s, user experience became an important concern for <em>designers</em>. It was <em>Donald Norman</em>, a user experience architect, who coined and brought the term user experience to wider knowledge.
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<b>Elements of user experience design</b>
<p>Visual design <em> graphic design, communication design, or visual communication</em>. The purpose of visual design is to use visual elements like colors, images, and symbols to convey a message to its audience. Fundamentals of <em>Gestalt psychology</em> and visual perception give a cognitive perspective on how to create effective visual communication.
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">see this</a>
  explains the distinction well.

<b>Information architecture</b>
<p>Information architecture is the art and science of structuring and organizing the information in products and services, supporting usability and findability. More basic concepts that are attached with information architecture are described below.
</p>

<b>Information</b>
<p>In the context of information architecture, <em>information is separate from both knowledge and data</em>, and lies nebulously between them. It is information about objects. The objects can range from websites, to software applications, to images et al. It is also concerned with <b>metadata</b>: terms used to describe and represent content objects such as documents, people, process, and organizations.
</p>

<b>Structuring, organization, and labeling</b>
<p><em>Structuring</em> is reducing information to its basic building units and then relating them to each other. <em>Organization</em> involves grouping these units in a distinctive and meaningful manner. <em>Labeling</em> means using appropriate wording to support easy navigation and findability.
